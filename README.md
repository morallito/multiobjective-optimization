# multiobjective-optimization
## Description
This Github repository contains the code and reports for the Multiobjective Optimization class. The class is designed to teach students about advanced optimization techniques for solving problems that involve multiple, often conflicting objectives.

The repository contains code for various multiobjective optimization algorithms and techniques, including Pareto optimization, weighted sum method, epsilon-constraint method, and more. The code is implemented in Python and includes both the algorithms themselves as well as examples of how to use them to solve practical multiobjective optimization problems.

In addition to the code, the repository also includes reports that describe the theory behind each multiobjective optimization technique and provide examples of how to use the code to solve different types of problems. These reports are written in LaTeX and are formatted to be easily read and understood.

Whether you are a student taking the Multiobjective Optimization class or simply interested in learning more about advanced optimization techniques, this repository provides a wealth of information and resources to help you understand and apply these techniques to real-world problems. With the code and reports readily available, you can explore and experiment with various multiobjective optimization methods, and find solutions that are optimal across multiple conflicting objectives.
